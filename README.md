# Basic_RSA_Encryption
Read the BigInteger Class and the PDF in the information folder to understand the code. The PDF is not my own, but was the resource I used to learn how to do this.

# Important Disclaimer
This code is *NOT* meant to be used in actual cryptography. I created this code ONLY for the purposes of presentations/lectures where I
explain the mathematics (from the PDF) and then translate math into code. This code would not be a secure method of actually encrypting data,
it is only suitable for the purposes of showing people how the math works and visualizing the change from strings to really big integers.
